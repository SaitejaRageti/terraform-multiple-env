I have built a clean and environment-specific Terraform project structure using separate S3 buckets per environment, along with isolated variable files and backend configs. That's a great way to manage infrastructure in a multi-environment setup without relying on Terraform workspaces.

**Here’s a complete README.md section that documents**:

**🌍 Multi-Environment Terraform Setup with S3 Remote State**

This Terraform project manages EC2 infrastructure across two environments — dev and prod — using separate S3 buckets for each environment’s state file and environment-specific .tfvars files.

📁 Project Structure

tf-vars/
│
├── ec2.tf               # EC2 resource definition
├── provider.tf          # AWS provider + S3 backend block (not filled here)
├── variables.tf         # All input variables used by ec2.tf
│
├── prod/
│   ├── backend.tf       # S3 backend config for prod environment
│   ├── prod.tfvars      # Overrides for prod (e.g., env = "prod")
│
└── dev/
    ├── backend.tf       # S3 backend config for dev environment
    ├── dev.tfvars       # Overrides for dev (e.g., env = "dev")


**⚙️ What This Setup Does**


Separates infrastructure for dev and prod using distinct:

Remote state backends (each has its own S3 bucket)

Variable override files (*.tfvars)

Uses one common set of .tf files to manage EC2 resources.

Avoids the use of Terraform workspaces, instead relying on file/folder separation.

**🧪 Terraform Workflow**

🟢 Initialize for dev environment:

terraform init -backend-config=dev/backend.tf -reconfigure

terraform plan   -var-file=dev/dev.tfvars

terraform apply  -var-file=dev/dev.tfvars -auto-approve

🔴 Destroy dev resources:


terraform destroy -var-file=dev/dev.tfvars -auto-approve

🟢 Initialize for prod environment:

terraform init -backend-config=prod/backend.tf -reconfigure

terraform plan   -var-file=prod/prod.tfvars

terraform apply  -var-file=prod/prod.tfvars -auto-approve

🔴 Destroy prod resources:


terraform destroy -var-file=prod/prod.tfvars -auto-approve


🔁 Use -reconfigure during terraform init to reinitialize the backend when switching environments.(Note)


**✅ Pros and ❌ Cons of This Setup**

✅ Pros
Clear separation of environments: No accidental deployments to the wrong environment.

Environment-specific remote state: Each environment uses its own S3 bucket for state tracking.

Modular and maintainable: Shared logic in root .tf files, with environment-specific overrides.

No reliance on workspaces: Easier to manage in CI/CD pipelines and easier visibility into file-based structure.

❌ Cons
Manual environment switching: Requires reinitialization (-reconfigure) when switching environments.

More boilerplate: Duplicated folder structures (dev/, prod/) for backend and tfvars.

More room for error in copy-pasting configs: Risk of using the wrong bucket or vars in the wrong environment if not careful.

No dynamic selection: Unlike workspaces, which allow switching with a single command (terraform workspace select), this requires file-based control.


**📌 Notes**
Both dev and prod folders must contain valid backend.tf with proper S3 bucket names and key paths.

Keep the .tfvars files lightweight and only include environment-specific overrides.

If using CI/CD, this structure is ideal for passing different *.tfvars and backend configs as part of your deployment logic.
